```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. Create a `Header2` header below with the name "Answer 1".

## Answer 1

2. Add an unordered list (in Markdown syntax) of your favorite food dishes and add their ingredients as sub-items in the list. You should enter at least two
dishes with two ingredients each.

* Favorite Foods
  + Hawaiian Pizza
    - Dough
    - Cheese
    - Tomato Sauce
    - Pineapple
    - Ham
  + Cookies
    - Flour
    - Sugar
    - Butter
    - Baking Powder
    - Chocolate Chips

3. Add an R code chunk below. Show the `summary` of the `Orange` dataset. Run a linear regression using the `lm` function to predict `circumference` from `age` and assign the result. Show the `summary` of the fit object that you assigned. 

```{r}
data("Orange")
summary(Orange)
circumference.lm <- lm(circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
summary(circumference.lm)
```


4. Add a link below (_in RMarkdown format_) to your favorite R reference website.

<https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>


5. Replace the author field in the `yaml` header with your name and `knit` the RMarkdown document into a Word document (make sure that the document 'knits').
First clone the `CUNYSPHcode/IntroR_FinalAssignment` onto your GitHub account. Then, create a pull request on GitHub with the **modified** RMarkdown file.
